When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are creating a group project. 
When you are using multiple computers to work on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you have more control on the files in your local repo. You may not necessarily 
want to add the changes made in the remote repo to your local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Fork - to copy a Git repo to another GitHub account.
Clone - to copy a local repo to another local repo
branch - to copy a branch within a local repo

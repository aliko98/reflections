What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a .git repository. You need to create it so that it will track changes to the files
in that directory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is where you put the files from the working directory to hold until you are ready to 
commit the changes. It's useful because it gives you the option to choose which specific files in the working directory
you want to commit and track changes in a logical manner.

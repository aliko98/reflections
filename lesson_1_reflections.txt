How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It pointed out the differences between two versions of the same project. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can see your workflow. 
You can review what worked and what didn't work and keep that in mind for the future.
You can see how a file evolved. 
You can retrace your steps.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Web projects require different types of files that are connected, like HTML, CSS, JS. Change in one 
or more of those files can affect the other. It would be good to commit changes to all 3 at 
the same time so you know the state of each file at each commit. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use git log to see all the commits
use git diff to see what changes were made between commits. you can see what was added
and what was deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I won't worry about trying out new changes and breaking things because if I do I can always
revert to the previous version.
